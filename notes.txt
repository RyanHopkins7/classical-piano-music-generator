A different Markov Chain object should be created for each and every key signature to avoid disharmony.
This will also allow the user to select a key signature before generating a piece.

Stores info about pitch, duration of note, and delta time since each previous note in the memory buffer.

Use an order 10 markov chain (10 last states are remembered) with weights decaying over time.
Rather than weights decaying based on time from present to end of last note, they should decay based on the 
difference of time between the end of the last note and the end of the previous note.

This is because since a human has 10 fingers, no more than 10 notes will be played at a time in the midi file.
Since I want decisions about future notes to be made based on all current notes, this ensures that the markov chain 
can always contain enough information to always make decisions about future notes based on all current notes.

Necessary to read notes from all tracks and save data in the same markov chain.
